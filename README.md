# Counters
iOS Universal app. Fills the screen up with a resettable number of counters. Every counter has its own initial speed (and a matching color brightness) but changeable while counting is running. Developed with Autolayout, multi-threading (with GCD and NSOperation) and gesture recognition.

Updated so that every Counter has now a UIProgressView to shown counting progression.
